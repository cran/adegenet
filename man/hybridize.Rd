\title{Function hybridize takes two genind in inputs
and generates hybrids individuals having one parent
in both objects.}
\usage{
hybridize(x1, x2, n, pop = "hybrid", res.type = c("genind", "df",
  "STRUCTURE"), file = NULL, quiet = FALSE, sep = "/", hyb.label = "h")
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{a \linkS4class{genind} object}

\item{x2}{a \linkS4class{genind} object}

\item{n}{an integer giving the number of hybrids requested}

\item{pop}{a character string giving naming the population of the
created hybrids.}

\item{res.type}{a character giving the type of output requested. Must
be "genind" (default), "df" (i.e. data.frame like in
\code{\link{genind2df}}), or "STRUCTURE" to generate a .str file
readable by STRUCTURE (in which case the 'file' must be supplied). See
'details' for STRUCTURE output.}

\item{file}{a character giving the name of the file to be written
when 'res.type' is "STRUCTURE"; if NULL, a the created file is of the
form "hybrids\_[the current date].str".}

\item{quiet}{a logical specifying whether the writing to a file (when
'res.type' is "STRUCTURE") should be announced (FALSE, default) or
not (TRUE).}

\item{sep}{a character used to separate two alleles}

\item{hyb.label}{a character string used to construct the hybrids
labels; by default, "h", which gives labels: "h01", "h02", "h03",...}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{genind} object (by default), or a data.frame of alleles
(res.type="df"). No R output if res.type="STRUCTURE" (results written
to the specified file).
}
\description{
The function \code{hybridize} performs hybridization between two set
of genotypes stored in \linkS4class{genind} objects (referred as the "2
populations"). Allelic frequencies are derived for each population,
and then gametes are sampled following a multinomial distribution. \cr
}
\details{
The result consists in a set of 'n' genotypes, with different possible
outputs (see 'res.type' argument).


  If the output is a STRUCTURE file, this file will have the following
 caracteristics:\cr
 - file contains the genotypes of the parents, and then the genotypes
 of hybrids\cr
 - the first column identifies genotypes\cr
 - the second column identifies the population (1 and 2 for parents x1 and x2;
 3 for hybrids)\cr
 - the first line contains the names of the markers\cr
 - one row = one genotype (onerowperind will be true)\cr
 - missing values coded by "-9" (the software's default)\cr

\dontrun{
## Let's make some cattle hybrids
data(microbov)

## first, isolate each breed
temp <- seppop(microbov)
names(temp)
salers <- temp$Salers
zebu <- temp$Zebu

## let's make some... Zeblers
zebler <- hybridize(salers, zebu, n=40,
                    pop="Zebler")


## now let's merge all data into a single genind
newDat <- repool(microbov, zebler)

## make a correspondance analysis
## and see where hybrids are placed
X <- genind2genpop(newDat, quiet=TRUE)
coa1 <- dudi.coa(tab(X),scannf=FALSE,nf=3)
s.label(coa1$li)
add.scatter.eig(coa1$eig,2,1,2)
